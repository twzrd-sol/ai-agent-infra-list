The Most Comprehensive Collection of AI Agent Infrastructure Open Source Projects [Continuously Updated]

# Introduction

The importance of AI Agents is an industry consensus, with the current biggest bottleneck being model capabilities, especially model reasoning abilities. However, with the release of o1, perhaps we can shift some attention to other bottlenecks. This is the original intention behind writing this article.

The AI Agent Infrastructure discussed in this article does not include models, but rather focuses on other infrastructure components besides models, such as memory, tools, frameworks, containers, etc.

The reason for writing this article is that I often come across excellent open source projects but have no place to record them. Sometimes when looking for an open source project, it's difficult to find. Therefore, this article has three purposes:

- To have a place to record excellent and creative open source projects

- To help AI Agent developers quickly find suitable infrastructure

- To help AI Agent developers quickly understand the current state of AI Agent infrastructure development


For now, we only collect open source projects, though we may include commercial products in the future.

I will continuously update this article, perhaps once a month, adding excellent and creative projects each time. Additionally, I plan to maintain this article as an open source project. I have created a GitHub repository at: [https://github.com/chgaowei/ai-agent-infra-list](https://github.com/chgaowei/ai-agent-infra-list).

If you know of any excellent open source projects, have different opinions about certain projects, or wish to promote your open source project, feel free to submit a PR.

We have also created an AI Agent Infra discussion group. Welcome to join:

WeChat: Please add WeChat ID changshan02, with note "AI discussion group".

Also welcome to join Discord to discuss with global tech professionals: [https://discord.gg/BNJdvMa5XE](https://discord.gg/BNJdvMa5XE)


## This Month's Recommended Projects

Each monthly update will recommend one or more projects. This month, we'd like to recommend our open source project **AgentConnect**:

AgentConnect's vision is to define how agents connect and build an open, secure, and efficient collaboration network for billions of agents. AgentConnect provides the following capabilities:

- Provides a decentralized authentication method based on W3C DID specification, allowing agents to control their own identity and perform cross-platform, secure, low-cost identity verification with any other agent.

- Supports DID-based end-to-end encrypted communication, ensuring secure communication between agents.

- Supports meta-protocol negotiation, allowing agents to negotiate capabilities and communication protocols using natural language, and use LLM to generate code for protocol communication. This helps achieve self-organizing and self-negotiating agent networks.

- Supports application layer protocol management, enabling convenient loading, updating, and unloading of protocols and protocol code, helping improve communication efficiency between agents.
